# project_explorer
This is a simple file browser that uses project based concepts.

Each tab represents a different project, and each project can have multiple roots open. A root is a folder that needs to be viewed to work on the project.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
**Important Note:** The "Delete" action deletes the selected files/folders immediately without confirmation or sending to trash!
